# Capstone Project - Airbnb Bangkok Listings

## Project Overview

This is the Module 2 Capstone Project for the DTI Data Science Program at Purwadhika Digital School. In this project, I used Pandas to explore the Airbnb Listings Bangkok dataset. I also conducted statistical testing using the Scipy module and visualized my findings using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Background

According to Airbnb, Bangkok became the most popular destination city for tourists in Thailand, which is also the most visited country in Southeast Asia in 2023. As a major hub for international travelers, the city attracts millions of visitors annually, ranging from backpackers and digital nomads to luxury travelers. Thai government also introduced the Destination Thailand Visa to attract remote workers, digital nomads, and freelancers.

The number of nights reserved in Thailand on Airbnb in 2023 increased by almost 60% year over year as the travel industry continues to flourish. 
In Thailand, group travel by Airbnb visitors surged by nearly 80% in 2023 compared to a 52% increase in solo travel for the same time frame. 
Long-term stays also increased by more than 20% in the first half of 2024.

This rapid growth in Airbnb reservations and the diversity of travelers coming to Bangkok highlight the importance of understanding market trends and optimizing Airbnb’s offerings in the city. By analyzing key factors such as pricing, listing types, and guest preferences, Airbnb can better meet the needs of both hosts and travelers while maximizing revenue potential.

## Business Problem

With the increasing number of reservation in Bangkok, Airbnb wants to optimize pricing and enhance guest experiences to strengthen Airbnb's competitive position, therefore increasing its total revenue. Analyzing the characteristics of popular listings—such as their location, room type, and other key attributes—will provide Airbnb with actionable insights on what attracts more bookings. 

How do different factors such as district, room type, and price affect booking rates and traveler preferences for Airbnb listings in Bangkok?
